1. Get vagrant - go to https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and get the latest
$ dpkg -i vagrant_1.6.2_x86_64.deb

2. while in this directory bring up the vagrant machine
~/fds-src/vagrant/devstack$ vagrant up

3. SSH into the vagrant box
~/fds-src/vagrant/devstack$ vagrant ssh

4. If this is the first time running this vagrant box, use the setup to get devstack and its dependencies from github - during this it will ask you to configure the mysql root password - I suggest you use 'stackdb' (without quotes) as your password
$ /vagrant/install_deps.sh

5. (optional). A devstack configuration file (local.conf) is in the vagrant directory which is mapped to vagrant which has the networking already set up.  
$ cp /vagrant/local.conf ~/devstack/local.conf

6. Run stack.sh to bring up devstack, it takes a while - get coffee
~/devstack$ ./stack.sh

The administration interface should be available at http://192.168.83.10/
The password is in the local.conf (or set when you launch stach.sh if you aren't using local.conf)

This fds-src dir on the host machine is mounted to /fds-src
