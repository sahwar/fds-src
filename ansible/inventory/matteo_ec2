# This inventory file works for an as-yet-undefined host group named ec2hosts.
#  The group name is defined dynamically by way of running the
#  'deploy_fds_ec2.yml' playbook and passing in the name of this file as the
#  value for fds_cluster_name. This allows us to still use our
#  FDS-specific variables that you can customize as you need, without having
#  to hard-code any of them into the playbook.

# The 'localhost' entry is mandatory! Ansible's EC2 module needs to be run
#  against localhost, since it's just interacting with the EC2 APIs. You
#  fortunately don't need anything more than this simple entry.
# The 'awo-bh-01' is necessary for now, as Ansible's wait_for and
#  delegate_to modules don't play nice together at this time.
