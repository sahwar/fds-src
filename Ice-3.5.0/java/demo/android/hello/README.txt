This directory contains an Eclipse project for the hello client.

The hello client is the Android equivalent of our command-line demo
of the same name. In order to use this client, you must run a hello
server and enter the server's address in the client's "Hostname"
field. You can use a server from your Ice installation.

Please refer to the release notes for instructions on configuring
your environment to use Ice in an Android project.
