This example demonstrates the use of the Freeze Transactional Evictor
to implement a reliable gambling operation.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In another window, start the client:

$ client

You can run a number of clients concurrently (in different windows)
to exercise the server even more.

Highlights:
----------

- The public interface of the server is specified in Casino.ice;
  CasinoStore.ice is just an implementation detail of the server.

- This demo uses a transactional evictor per servant type; this 
  is more efficient than storing different types of servants in
  the same Freeze transactional evictor.

- Transactions often span servants in several evictors; this works
  because all the evictors use the same underlying Berkeley DB 
  environment.

- The application code does not deal at all with database deadlocks;
  Freeze retries automatically (and correctly) each time a deadlock is
  detected and reported by Berkeley DB.

- The application code does not perform any synchronization: with
  a Freeze transactional evictor, the servants you get are either
  totally read-only or private to your thread/transaction.

- Destroying a player while this player is participating in a bet
  is an interesting life-cycle situation. What happens if this player
  wins a bet and is destroyed at the same time? Will chips get lost?
  In fact, there is no issue thanks to Berkeley DB locking:
  when a bet picks a winner, it invokes an operation on this object
  (through a proxy) within a transaction. At this point, if the 
  object is still alive, it's locked by the transaction, which
  prevents another transaction from acquiring a write lock (for 
  example, to destroy it).
