The experiments infrastructure currently allows to run a set of workloads, one on each 
volume on one (local) SH

(0) [once] 
 > cd pharos; 
 > cd libposix-aio-0.8.1; ./configure; make; make install
 > cd ..; make

(1) Bring up the OM, SM(s), DM(s)
(2) './run-experiments options' will start ubd and do insmod fbd.ko
See ./run-experiments -h for options

Example of running 3 workloads:

./run-experiment -p "demo" -w "sample_workloads/read_N_outstand.sh:100,200,1" -w "sample_workloads/read_N_outstand.sh:200,500,2" -2 "sample_workloads/read_N_outstand.sh:100,300,5"

Each -w option specifies a workload (read_N_outstand.sh calls a workload generator with read workload that keeps fixed number of 
outstanding IO/s). Then, after ":", specify policy "min_iops,max_iops,priority". 

The run-experiments.sh script will create one policy for each -w option (even if we repeat the same min_iops/max_iops/prio  numbers
with -w option, it will be a different policy with its unique id). Then, it will create one volume for each -w option, and
then attach all volumes to localhost-sh node.

Then, it will start all workload .sh files and wait for them to finish. Then, it will make graphs and clean up (remove all volumes 
and all policies, and stop ubd and rmmod fbd.ko).

The script also tries to make graph from SH stats output, but Note that currently SH stats are broken. If workload sh calls 
Pharos workload generator, it makes graphs from Pharos output. 

The graphs will be in ./results/pdfs directory prefixed with string passed with -p option ("demo" in my example).
