5 Jun 2006 - Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>
	* Release 0.8.1
	* Fixed building from a network filesystem.
	  added --with-testdir=<directory> option to configure for specifying
	  where to put testfiles for detecting the kernel level of support.
	* Removed __USE_XOPEN2K and _USE_GNU defines from aio_event.c,
	  aio_read.c and aio_write.c. Replaced with -D_GNU_SOURCE in Makefile.am


13 Mar 2006 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>
	* Release 0.8
	* Fixed x86_64 port
	* Fixed testcases volatile variables

29 Dec 2005 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>

	* Added a warning in the README concerning the requests alignement
	  issues.

04 Nov 2005 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>

	* Release V 0.7

	* Merged IO_CMD_EVENT and IO_CMD_CHECKPOINT into IO_CMD_GROUP for
	  listio support.

	* Fixed buf type from unsigned char * to char * for gcc4 in
	  check/aio_fsync.c.

	* Do not use the aiocb->data to store a pointer to the aiocb. This field
	  was used in update_events() in src/aio_event.c to retrieve the aiocb from
	  the io_event. We can instead use event->obj.

	* Added missing comma in aio_syscall4 in src/syscall_x86.h.

	* Added --enable-debug option to configure for compiling the library with
	  debug symbols. Changed configure.ac and src/Makefile.am

	* Changed __aio_thread_init() to take a sigevent as arg instead of an aiocb.

	* Added new listio testcases in check.

22 Jul 2005 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>

	* Release V 0.6

	* Fixed compilation errors when none of the kernel patches are applied i.e.
   	  no support for AIO and LIO completion signal and no support for io_setup (0, ...).
   	  Problem found by Michael Feiman from Platform Computing Corporation.

	* Removed automatic checking of kernel support for buffered AIO in configure.ac.
	  The feature must be manually enabled or disabled. Default right now is disabled.

	* Bug fixes concerning buffered AIO support in aio_read and aio_write.

	* Fixed the type of the buffer (from unsigned char * to char *) used for the AIO
	  request in a few places in testbed for consistency. These were causing error
	  when compiled with gcc 4.0. Thanks for Pradeep Padala for spotting this one.

	* Added mini testsuite so that doing a `make check` after building the library
	  makes sure everything is in order before installing. Currently the aio_fsync
	  and aio_cancel checks fail due to lack of support from the kernel.

21 Jun 2005 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>

	* Release V 0.5

	* Fixed CFLAGS in configure.ac for detecting kernel AIO support.

	* Added gcc optimization flag (-O3) in src/Makefile.am so that the library
	  is compiled with optimizations by default.

	* Optimized completion events fetching.
	  In __aio_get_res, update_events is called to retrieve completion events from the
	  kernel via the io_getevents syscall. As io_getevents may return more than one
	  event from the completion queue, it makes sense to check whether the event we're
	  interested in has not already been retrieved and thus avoid systematically doing
	  a syscall.

03 May 2005 -  Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>

	* Release V 0.4

	* The aiocb data structure changed in order to match more closely
	  the kernel iocb.  The first 64 bytes of the aiocb correspond to the iocb.

	* Licence changed to LGPL

	* Copyright changed to BULL

18 Mar 2005 - Sébastien Dugué <Sebastien.Dugue@bull.net>
	* Release V 0.3

	* libposix-aio does not rely on libaio anymore as we were only using the
	  syscall wrappers it provides for kernel AIO.
	
	  Syscalls are now directly implemented in libposix-aio.

	* kernel patches updated against 2.6.10 are now distributed as a quilt patchset
	
	* some bug fixes

22 Dec 2004 - Laurent Vivier <Laurent.Vivier@bull.net>

	* change on-the-fly the file descriptor property to O_DIRECT
	* if I/O buffer is not aligned to a 512 byte frontier,
	  use temporary aligned buffer (can have performance and 
	  compatiblity issues)
	* check if O_SYNC is equal to O_DSYNC, if true disable O_DSYNC

26 Nov 2004 - Laurent Vivier <Laurent.Vivier@bull.net>

	* First Release
