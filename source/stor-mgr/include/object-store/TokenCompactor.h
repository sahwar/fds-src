/**
 * Current token compaction process:
 *
 * 1) startCompaction() method starts the compaction process. It tells
 * the persistence layer to start writing new data to new file, but still
 * keep the old file (for reads while we are compacting data). It starts
 * timer to go to next step.
 *
 * 2) Send an FDS_SM_SNAPSHOT_TOKEN request to QoS queue. When this request
 * is processed we take a snapshot of index db and do step 3.
 *
 * 2) We iterate through the snapshot of index db and create a work item
 * (an SM IO request of type FDS_SM_COMPACT_OBJECTS) per each
 * GC_COPY_WORKLIST_SIZE number of object ids. Before we create work items,
 * we sort all object ids by their offsets, so that when we copy objects,
 * we are not seeking all over the place in the token file.
 *
 * 3). When 'copy' work item is dispatched from qos queue, compactObjectsCb() method
 * is called. For each object in object list, we will verify with index db again
 * if each of this object must be copied or not, and copy if needed.
 * 
 * TokenCompactor keeps track of objects it compacted, and once all of 
 * the objects of this token are compacted, TokenCompactor will call callback function
 * provided with startCompaction() method to notify that compaction is completed.
