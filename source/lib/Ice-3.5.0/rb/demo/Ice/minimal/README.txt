This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

The Ice extension for Ruby currently supports only client-side
functionality, therefore you must use a server from any other language
mapping.

After starting the server, run the Ruby client:

$ ruby Client.rb

Note that this demo hardwires port 10000. If port 10000 is not
available on your machine, you need to edit both client and server
to use a free port.
