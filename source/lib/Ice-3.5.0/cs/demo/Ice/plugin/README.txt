This demo illustrates how to write and configure a simple Ice plugin
as well as a Ice Logger plugin.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server.exe

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client.exe

Both the client and server use a custom logger which is loaded as
a logger plugin. The server also uses a plugin to implement the
servant for this demo.

Please Look in the client and sever configuration files to see the
plugin configuration.
