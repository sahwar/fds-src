This demo illustrates how to write and configure a simple Ice plug-in
as well as an Ice Logger plug-in.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client

Both the client and server use a custom logger that is loaded as
a logger plug-in. The server also uses a plug-in to implement the
servant for this demo.

Please review the client and sever configuration files to see the
plug-in configuration.

For the server or client to be able to find the library containing the
plug-in, you must add the current directory to your shared library
search path (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac
OS X, etc.). Alternatively, you can copy the library to a directory
that is already in your search path.
