This demo demonstrates how to configure and deploy HA IceStorm using
IceGrid.

To run the demo, start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ subscriber

In another window:

$ publisher

While the publisher continues to run, "tick" messages should be
displayed in the subscriber window.

The IceGrid application described in `application.xml' deploys three
IceStorm service replicas. With three replicas, any single replica can
become unavailable, and IceStorm will continue to function. However,
should two replicas become unavailable, replication will halt until another
instance comes back online.

For more information on the configuration of HA IceStorm please see
the Ice manual.

Other than configuration, the subscribers and publishers do not have
to do anything special to take advantage of the replication. The
subscriber and publisher are identical to those contained in the clock
demo. See ../clock/README for instructions on running them.
