# We want to install from a deployable package.
# To do this, after you build, then create the deployable package:
# See https://formationds.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/Creating+FDS+Packages
# Then make sure you've got an "install" section in your FDS Scenario config.

# This is the FDS Scenario config.
# Parameters for the test suite. fds_config_file is required.
