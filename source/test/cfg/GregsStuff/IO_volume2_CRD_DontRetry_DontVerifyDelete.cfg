# This SysTest config generates CREATE, READ, and DELETE
# activity (in that order for a given Blob) against S3 volume volume2. It is set
# to generate this activity for 120 seconds.
# Upon failure it not attempt a retry.
#
# Note that given the order of operations, READs following the CREATE most likely take place
# from cache.
