# TEST DESCRIPTION
# This SysTest config generates CREATE, READ, and DELETE
# activity (in that order for a given Blob) against S3 volume volume1. It is set
# to generate this activity for 120 seconds, retrying the operation
# upon failure, but without verifying that DELETEs were properly
# recorded. (We verify CREATEs by the subsequent READ.)
#
# Note that given the order of operations, READs most likely take place
# from cache.
