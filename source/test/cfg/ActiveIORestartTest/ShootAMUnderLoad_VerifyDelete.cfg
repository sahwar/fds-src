# TEST DESCRIPTION
# This SysTest config expects a domain to be up and running,
# spawns some I/O, shoots the AM, and validates that the AM is restarted
# and the application (which is set to retry failed requests) is able to
# continue after the AM is restarted.
#
# WARNING: Querying non-existent blobs with Boto (as is done with these tests) have proven
# to be extremely slow (nearly a minute per missing blob). See FS-2604 for details.
