# TEST DESCRIPTION
# This SysTest config generates CREATE, READ, and DELETE
# activity (in that order for a given Blob) against S3 volume volume1. It is set
# to generate this activity for 120 seconds, retrying the operation
# upon failure, and verifying that DELETEs were properly
# recorded (by expecting a subsequent READ to fail).
#
# Note that given the order of operations, READs following the CREATE most likely take place
# from cache.
#
# WARNING: Querying non-existent blobs with Boto (as is done with these tests) have proven
# to be extremely slow (nearly a minute per missing blob). See FS-2604 for details.
