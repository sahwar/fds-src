Vagrantfile for creating a 4-node VirtualBox VM cluster with a base Ubuntu 13.10 install.

Each VM is configured with 2 CPU and 2 GB memory
Network configured with 3 interfaces:
  NAT
  private host-only 10.1.33.10[1-4]
  bridged (en0) 

Shared folders are mounted at 

  /vagrant (standard vagrant mount point)

  /projects ~/projects
      -- this is where I clone git repositories etc on my mac

See https://formationds.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11993131 for Formation setup instructions

Known Issues:
-------------
1. timezone setup isn't working
2. formation.conf, platform.conf, orch_mgr.conf files (in /vagrant) are subject to change in product.  Rather than
  keeping these versions up to date with product code changes, it would be better to have a tool to
  automate updates to the files when installing Formation.
